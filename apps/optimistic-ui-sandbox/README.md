# Optimistic UI Sandbox

This isn‚Äôt your typical boring todo app.

It features a built-in **Controls Panel** where you can simulate **network latency** and trigger **server errors** to see how the app behaves under stress. Every interaction uses **optimistic UI updates**, so changes appear instantly while "background operations complete", just like in real-world apps.

There‚Äôs **no real API**, everything is **fully mocked**, including delays and failures, to simulate realistic network conditions.

A hands-on playground to explore how a real UI should behave when things go wrong, from slow responses to failed requests.
